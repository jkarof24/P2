Regression is a tool in statistics used to understand the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. For regression to be both accurate and reliable, a set of assumptions needs to be met. These assumptions are independence of errors, linearity, homoscedasticity, normality of errors, multicollinearity, and correct model specifications. If these assumptions are not met, it can introduce bias and inaccuracies in the regression model.
