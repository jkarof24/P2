This section will focus on the theoretical background needed to understand how to create regression models and how to test a model's reliability and significance.

\noindent The theory in sections 4.1 through 4.5 is based on the book 'Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists' \cite{ProbAndStat}. \newline

\noindent Statistics is a field in mathematics, that gives tools to analyse and understand data. Statistics comes in two branches, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics is used to describe the general tendencies in some data, such as finding the mean and variance, but no predictions or conclusion are made beyond the data itself. In contrast, inferential statistic is the branch of statistics that makes predictions and generalisations of a population based on a sample, this includes methods such as hypothesis testing and regressions. \newline

\noindent To address the challenges that occur, when  assumptions of modeling regressions through classical means are violated, a fundamental statistical understanding is needed. This section introduces the foundational concept of statistics that is required to understand regression models.
