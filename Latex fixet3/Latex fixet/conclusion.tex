In this project, synthetic data was used to demonstrate the effect of violating the assumption of homoscedasticity on polynomial regression from the ordinary least squares method, and polynomial regression from Monte Carlo Bootstrapping. The results show that the bootstrap model exhibits superior predictive accuracy, as evidenced by its lower RMSE. It is 1377 for the bootstrap, and 1921 for OLS, it also has a smaller MBE, 22 for the bootstrapped model and -539 for the OLS model. Furthermore, the standard errors and confidence intervals produced by the OLS model are shown to be unreliable, whereas those from the bootstrap method are more trustworthy, as they are based on the empirical variation in the data. Overall, the bootstrap approach proves to be excellent in terms of predictive power and robustness, especially in cases where the data is homoscedastic.
