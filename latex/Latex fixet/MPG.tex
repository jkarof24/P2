Noticing if assumptions are not met is important when working with data.
An example of a data set containing violations in assumptions, specifically the assumptions of homscedasticity and no multicollinearity, is the "Miles Per Gallon" data set. Through the "Miles Per Gallon" it's possible to model the violations in the assumptions, as seen in \autoref{fig:1} and \autoref{fig:2}.

Multicollinearity can be seen in Figure 1. Multicollinearit occurs when independent variables are highly correlated with each other, and as a result, it becomes more difficult to isolate the individual effect of each variable in a regression model.
In this model it is shown through the numbers, where the high numbers suggest a strong linear relationship through the variables. So between 'displacement' and ' cylinders', the value is 0.95, which is close to 1 and therefore shows there is multicollinearity. \newline

There is an example of hetereoscedasticity in the 'mpg' and 'horsepower' scatterplot in Figure 2, where there is not constant variance of the residuals. This is seen because there is a big spread between the variables, especially when horsepower decreases.
