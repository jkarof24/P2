In this project, synthetic data was used to demonstrate the effete of violateing the assumption of homoscedasticity. on OLS polynomial regression and bootstrapped polynomial regression. The results show that the bootstrap model exhibits superior predictive accuracy, as evidenced by its lower RMSE. 1377 for the bootstrap vs. 1921 for OLS and smaller MBE 22 for the bootstrap vs. -539 for OLS. Furthermore, the standard errors and confidence intervals produced by the OLS model are shown to be unreliable, whereas those from the bootstrap method are more trustworthy, as they are based on the empirical variation in the data. Overall, the bootstrap approach proves to be excellent in terms of predictive power and robustness, especially in cases where the data is homoscedastic.
